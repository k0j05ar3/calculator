# Demo Simple Calculator
## Description
This is a website that holds a simple 4-function calculator that was made to practice the basic principles of web design and development. This project should be extremely similar to a basic calculator that one should be able to pick up at the Dollar Store. 

Users should be able to do the following:
- Perform simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division between 2 or more numbers
- See the numbers they input on the display screen
- See the result of whatever operation on the display screen
